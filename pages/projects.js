        Sigmundr is our newest rocket project! It was named after Simon
        Westerlund who started this association and also donated his homemade
        engine to us. The goal of this project is to improve on what we learned
        from our previous rocket Odin and get one step closer on designing our
        own hybrid engine from scratch.
